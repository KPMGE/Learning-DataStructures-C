# Learning Data Structures in C

### Goal 
This repository holds my programs and tests with data structures in the C
programming language. Gradually, I intent to add more and more programs in
order to learn more about data structures. I'm a fan of clean
code, so I'll use it as much as possible in my programs. Please, feel free
to check and copy any of these programs, I hope it helps :wink:.
